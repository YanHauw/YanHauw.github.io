            <h1>My journey to become a UCLA CS major</h1>

            <p>The most crucial pivot was the help of a fellow UCLA Engineering student. His name is Kevin. For most of the projects in CS31 and CS33, he was the one pulling me along. It could be that I was stuck on some coding problem that the inexperienced me couldn’t handle or that I was completely stressed out about not being able to set up my development environments/workspaces properly. He would share his approach to tackling the problems and always give me personal recommendations for making my development environment as smooth-sailing as his own was. I remember how he figured out how to finally install Visual Studio on my laptop after Professor Stahl, who taught us CS31, couldn’t do it and told me to “just get a new box”. Particularly memorable was how he made a video to explain to me how to set up the linux terminal which I needed to access the CS33 SEASNET servers (we were both in different parts of the world attending UCLA remotely due to Covid-19). </p>

            <p>At the points when I had to walk the path on my own, it was the decision that I made to be responsible for my goals and ambitions that helped me through. In the summer of 2020, I was taking CS32 for a second time after I had dropped it mid-quarter in Spring 2020 because the workload was too heavy. And here, unlike in CS31 and CS33, I was alone. I was on a tight deadline to complete CS32 this quarter without dropping it: the next opportunity to take CS32 would only be in Winter 2021 and the earliest I would be able to become a CS major would be Summer 2021. I had done horribly on the first midterm, and it was only on the second midterm that I regained some lost hope. The point in time came where I had to decide on whether to take CS32 for a letter grade or drop the grading basis to Pass/No Pass. In the former case, getting lower than a B- would spell the end of my CS journey. In the latter, I would only need to get a C. I spoke to Professor Edwin Ambrosio during office hours and he said that I was almost guaranteed a B-. All I needed was 2-3 more percentage points on the final or the last project.</p>
            
            <p>The reason I chose to pursue a career in Computer Science was to learn to build useful things for other people so that I could make the world a better place. But here I was worrying that I wouldn’t be able to get 2-3 more percentage points to get a B-. What a joke. Studying computer science is a lot more than getting the minimum grades required for your classes. If this was already such a struggle, how was I going to move on to become more advanced in the future? I kept the letter grading. For the 9 days after I had that thought, I worked the hardest I ever have in my entire life, focussing all my energy on working on the CS32 final and the massive project 4. I eventually got an A- in the class and was away from an A by less than 0.1 percentage points. </p>

            <p>As I am writing this memoir, I have just completed CS33 in the Fall of 2020 with a grade of A-. To my good friend, Kevin, without your help I would not be applying to make the switch to Computer Science next quarter and may never. As for exceeding the expectations that I had for myself in CS32 and CS33, they are insignificant when compared with my new knowledge of what pursuing a CS career is truly about and the amount by which I grew throughout this whole process.</p>
